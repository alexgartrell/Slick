Install info:

Requirements:
sudo apt-get install g++ libboost-thread1.40-dev flex bison ruby-dev libgtest-dev python-dev libevent-dev

Install thrift:

tar zxf thrift-0.4.0.tar.gz
cd thrift-0.4.0/
# apply stop-tthreaded.patch, included here.
patch -p1 < stop-tthreaded.patch
./configure
make
sudo make install
# Ensure /usr/local/lib is added to load path, which is where thrift is installed
sudo ldconfig

Make should work in this dir then.
